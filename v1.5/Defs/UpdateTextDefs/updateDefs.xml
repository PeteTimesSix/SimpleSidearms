		<content>&lt;i&gt;Please remember that Simple Sidearms is designed with customization in mind. Chances are that if a specific feature bothers you, there is an option in the mod settings to disable or alter it.&lt;/i&gt;|&lt;b&gt;Pawns now remember their weapons!&lt;/b&gt;|img:tuts/havePunch|img:tuts/rememberDropped|Pawns will now remember which weapon is their primary and will switch back to in once undrafted. They will also remember which weapons they are missing when forced to drop them. This includes dropping their primary weapon due to being downed. Once undrafted or done recovering in the hospital, they will automatically go retrieve them.</content>
